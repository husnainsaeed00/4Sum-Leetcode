This is a solution for the Four Sum problem. Given an array of integers, the goal is to find all unique quadruplets whose sum equals a given target value.

**Problem Description**
Given an array nums of n integers and a target value, we need to find all unique quadruplets [nums[a], nums[b], nums[c], nums[d]] such that:

0 <= a, b, c, d < n
a, b, c, d are distinct.
nums[a] + nums[b] + nums[c] + nums[d] == target
The solution uses a two-pointer approach to efficiently find the quadruplets. 
It sorts the array in ascending order, 
then iterates through the array with two nested loops to select the first two elements of the quadruplet. Inside the loops, 
it uses two pointers to handle the remaining two elements.
By adjusting the pointers based on the comparison with the target value, it finds the unique quadruplets that sum up to the target.

**Solution Explanation**
Sort the input array nums in ascending order.
Initialize an empty list results to store the unique quadruplets.
Iterate through the array using the first loop with variable i from 0 to len(nums) - 3.
Skip duplicate values for the first element: If i is greater than 0 and nums[i] is equal to nums[i-1], continue to the next iteration.
Within the first loop, use a second loop with variable j from i+1 to len(nums) - 2.
Skip duplicate values for the second element: If j is greater than i+1 and nums[j] is equal to nums[j-1], continue to the next iteration.
Use two pointers left and right to handle the remaining two elements.
Initialize left to j + 1 and right to len(nums) - 1.
While left is less than right, perform the following steps:
Calculate the current sum curr_sum as nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[left] + nums[right].
If curr_sum is less than the target, increment left.
If curr_sum is greater than the target, decrement right.
If curr_sum is equal to the target, append [nums[i], nums[j], nums[left], nums[right]] to results.
Skip duplicate values for the third element: While left is less than right and nums[left] is equal to nums[left+1], increment left.
Skip duplicate values for the fourth element: While left is less than right and nums[right] is equal to nums[right-1], decrement right.
Move the pointers towards the center by incrementing left and decrementing right.
Return results, which contains all the unique quadruplets that sum up to the target.
How to Use
**To use this solution, follow these steps:**

Instantiate the Solution class.
Call the fourSum method, passing in the nums array and the target value as arguments.
The method will return a list of unique quadruplets that satisfy the conditions.
You can process or display the result as needed.

Example
nums = [1, 0, -1, 0, -2, 2]
target = 0

solution = Solution()
result = solution.fourSum(nums, target)

print(result)
Output:
[[-2, -1, 1, 2], [-2, 0, 0, 2], [-1, 0, 0, 1]]

The example demonstrates how to find the unique quadruplets that sum up to the target value of 0 in the given nums array.

**Complexity Analysis**
The time complexity of this solution is O(n^3) since we have three nested loops. Sorting the array takes O(n log n) time,
and the two-pointer approach inside the loops takes O(n) time.

The space complexity is O(1) since we only use a constant amount of space to store the results and loop variables.
